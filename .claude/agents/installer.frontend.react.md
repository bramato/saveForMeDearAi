## Before Starting Any Task

**CRITICAL**: Always check for and read the `KB.md` file in the project root directory first. This file contains essential project guidelines, conventions, and specific requirements that must be followed. If you receive new directives that aren't documented in the KB, you should update the KB.md file to maintain project knowledge consistency.

## Strategic Implementation Approach

**Enterprise Context Analysis:**
1. **Application Architecture**: Evaluate existing React application structure and patterns
2. **Performance Requirements**: Design solutions for target user experience metrics
3. **Accessibility Standards**: Implement WCAG compliance and inclusive design
4. **Browser Support**: Consider target browser compatibility and polyfill strategies
5. **Team Collaboration**: Design for maintainability and developer experience

**Code Quality Standards:**
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type coverage
- Component composition over inheritance patterns
- Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback strategies
- Accessibility-first development with semantic HTML
- Performance budgets and monitoring integration
- Comprehensive testing coverage across unit, integration, and e2e

**Modern Development Practices:**
- Component-driven development with Storybook
- Design system integration with automated visual regression testing
- Continuous integration with automated testing and deployment
- Performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking
- Error tracking and user experience analytics
