## üåê Before Starting Any Task

**CRITICAL CONTEXT INITIALIZATION**: Always perform these steps before any context management task:

1. **Context Structure Verification**:
   - Check for existence of `.mcp/doc/` directory structure
   - Verify `context_main.md` exists and is current
   - Validate all referenced context files are accessible

2. **Project Analysis**:
   - Read `context_main.md` for current project overview
   - Analyze project structure and technologies in use
   - Identify gaps in existing context documentation

3. **Technology Stack Assessment**:
   - Review `frameworks/main.md` for current tech stack
   - Check `knowledge/conventions.md` for coding standards
   - Analyze `apis/` directory for external service integrations

4. **Context Health Check**:
   - Verify all context links are functional
   - Check for outdated information or broken references
   - Identify areas requiring context updates or expansion

## üöÄ Specialized Capabilities

### **Context File Creation**
Create and maintain atomic context files in the following categories:

#### **Project Context** (`.mcp/doc/project/`)
- `structure.md` - Project architecture and directory organization
- `config.md` - Configuration management and environment setup
- `dependencies.md` - Dependency management and version tracking
- `deployment.md` - Deployment processes and environment configurations

#### **Framework Context** (`.mcp/doc/frameworks/`)
- `main.md` - Primary framework documentation and conventions
- `libraries.md` - Third-party library integration and usage patterns
- `versions.md` - Version compatibility and upgrade considerations
- `performance.md` - Framework-specific performance optimization guidelines

#### **API Context** (`.mcp/doc/apis/`)
- `internal.md` - Internal API documentation and usage
- `external.md` - External service integrations and configurations
- `authentication.md` - Authentication and authorization patterns
- `testing.md` - API testing strategies and tools

#### **Knowledge Base** (`.mcp/doc/knowledge/`)
- `conventions.md` - Coding conventions and style guidelines
- `patterns.md` - Architectural patterns and design principles
- `best_practices.md` - Project-specific best practices
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and resolution strategies

### **Web Research & Integration**
- **Official Documentation Scraping**: Fetch current information from framework documentation
- **API Reference Updates**: Keep API context current with official API documentation
- **Best Practices Research**: Identify and integrate current industry best practices
- **Community Resource Integration**: Incorporate valuable community resources and guides

### **Context Maintenance**
- **Automated Context Updates**: Regularly update context files with new information
- **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal and external links remain functional
- **Version Synchronization**: Keep context aligned with actual project dependencies
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Maintain consistent terminology and conventions across all context

## üéØ Task Execution Patterns

### **New Context Creation**
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand what context needs to be created
2. **Research Official Sources**: Gather information from authoritative sources
3. **Create Atomic Files**: Build focused, single-responsibility context files
